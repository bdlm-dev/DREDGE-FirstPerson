# DREDGE First Person
The classic experience, now spookier than ever in first person.

Conversion of DREDGE from Third Person to First Person.

## Configurable
Via in-game 'Mods' tab config:
- FOV: default 60, limited 40-100 but further configurable via default_config.json
- Waves: First person at high speed on rough seas can induce motion sickness, so there's a toggle for the waves.

## Known Issues
- 'Dock UI buttons are duplicated'
  - I don't know why this happens, so can't fix this.
